        <h3>LocalStorage and SessionStorage</h3>
        <p>
          SessionStorage and LocalStorage are known as the web storage API. Data
          can be stored on the client side by using these APIs.
        </p>
        <h4>SessionStorage:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>SessionStorage is used for storing data on the client side.</li>
          <li>Maximum limit of data saving in SessionStorage is about 5 MB</li>
          <li>
            Data in the SessionStorage exist till the current tab is open if we
            close the current tab then our data will also erase automatically
            from theSessionStorage.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> If after closing the current tab we press ctrl+shift+T
          for restoring that tab, then ideally in SessionStorage data should not
          be there but we can see that SessionStorage is maintained in the
          chrome, firefox but not in the safari browser while restoring the tab.
          It is the browser dependent feature while restoring the tab.
        </p>
        <h4>LocalStorage:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Like SessionStorage, LocalStorage also used for storing the data on
            the client side.
          </li>
          <li>
            Maximum limit of data saving is about 5 MB in LocalStorage also.
          </li>
          <li>
            LocalStorage has no expiration time, Data in the LocalStorage
            persist till the user manually delete it. This is the only
            difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Scope in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Scope: </strong>It is a region of the program where a variable
          can be accessed. In other words, scope determines the
          accessibility/visibility of a variable. Since JavaScript looks like a
          C-family language, it is very obvious to think that scoping in
          JavaScript is similar to that in most of the back-end programming
          languages like C, C++, or Java.There’re 3 kinds of scopes in
          JavaScript:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Global scope</strong>: Variables declared outside of all
            functions are known as global variables and in the
            <i>global scope.</i> Global variables are accessible anywhere in the
            program.
          </li>
          <li style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Function scope</strong>: Variables that are declared inside
            a function are called local variables and in the
            <i>function scope.</i> Local variables are accessible anywhere
            inside the function. &nbsp;
          </li>
          <li style="text-align: justify">
            <strong>Block scope: </strong>Variable that is declared inside a
            specific block &amp; can’t be accessed outside of that block. In
            order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to
            create an object for it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is Event loop?</h3>
        <p>
          The event loop is basically an endless loop, which keeps on checking
          whether there is something to be executed in the call stack. If the
          call stack is empty it checks the Event Queue, whether there is
          something to move to the call stack. If there is a method present, it
          moves it to the call stack and the method gets executed.

        <h3> 8 ways to get Undefined</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li> variable that is not initialized will give undefined </li>
            <li>function with no return </li>  
            <li> parameter that is not passed will be undefined</li>
              <li> if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</li>
              <li>property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined</li> 
              <li>accessing array elements outside of the index range </li>  
              <li>deleting an element inside an array</li> 
              <li>set a value directly to undefined</li>
